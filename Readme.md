# Customizable web design patterns
### In order to achieve a simple and easy understanding 😀, each of the patterns presented below were created with real markup language through ```flexbox```, usually with three ```div``` of content within a main ```div``` container. Each sample was first written from the smallest view and breakpoints were added when necessary. The ```Flexbox``` design mode is very compatible with modern browsers; however, the provider may have to make prior adjustments to achieve optimal compatibility.

## Mostly Fluid 🚀
### The Mostly fluid pattern consists mainly of a fluid grid. In general, the same size is maintained on large or medium screens and the margins are simply adjusted to the widest.

## Column Drop 🙃
### During the column placement process they are only placed vertically because the window width is too small for the content.

### At one point, all columns are stacked vertically. The selection of breakpoints for this design pattern depends on the content and changes for each design.
